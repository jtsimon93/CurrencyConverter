# Currency Converter

I created this project to learn more about using JSON APIs with Python, as well as learning about npyscreen.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have npyscreen installed for this to work. Learn more about npyscreen here: http://npyscreen.readthedocs.io/ If you are running on Windows, you may need to install windows-curses Python package. 

The application starts at main.py. The actual API call and conversion happens in currencyconverter.py

### Dependencies

Utilize the `requirements.txt` file to install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

_Optionally_, you can install each dependency manually:

npyscreen, run:
```
pip install npyscreen
```

If you are running on Windows:

windows-curses, run:
```
pip install windows-curses
```

### Installing

Once you have cloned the repo and installed the dependencies, simply run main.py and you'll be on your way!
